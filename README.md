   - Name: `Windows Autopilot Standard`
   
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5eeec53e-3082-457d-8535-0fcc5de26a70)

   - Set **User-driven** mode
   - Join to Entra ID as: **Azure AD joined**
   - Assign a device naming convention

## Why Unique Device Names Matter

### 1. Avoid Naming Conflicts
- Duplicate device names can cause issues during registration in Entra ID (Azure AD), Intune, or traditional Active Directory.
- Unique names help prevent conflicts and ensure accurate policy application.

### 2. Improve Device Management & Searchability
- Unique and structured names make it easier for administrators to locate, filter, and manage devices in Intune.
- Clear naming conventions support faster identification of devices based on users, locations, or departments.

### 3. Support Compliance & Auditability
- Many organizations require device tracking for compliance, security, and audits.
- Unique names assist with logging, asset inventory, and incident response processes.

### 4. Enable Automation & Scripting
- Scripts for automation, patching, or monitoring often rely on consistent naming.
- Unique names prevent errors in automated processes.

## Device Naming Rules and Constraints

| Rule                            | Reason                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Maximum of 15 characters        | Ensures compatibility with legacy NetBIOS naming requirements.        |
| Use only letters, numbers, and hyphens | Complies with Windows naming and DNS standards.                     |
| Cannot consist of only numbers  | Prevents conflicts with numeric-only identifiers.                     |
| No blank spaces                 | Avoids issues in scripts, parsing, and legacy system compatibility.   |

## Using Naming Macros in Intune

| Macro         | Description                                                                             |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `%SERIAL%`    | Inserts the device's hardware serial number for unique, hardware-based naming.          |
| `%RAND:x%`    | Inserts a random alphanumeric string of `x` characters to ensure unique device names.   |

### Examples

- `LAPTOP-%SERIAL%` â†’ Generates names like `LAPTOP-ABC12345`
- `DESKTOP-%RAND5%` â†’ Generates names like `DESKTOP-K7X2B`
